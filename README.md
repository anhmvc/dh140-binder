# DH140 Assignment 07: Stats & Modeling with Shakespeare play

## Notebook Description
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that runs an statistic analysis on texts in the Shakespeare's play -- Romeo and Juliet. The notebook processed the play by reading from a .txt file and tokenize/stem/calculate words frequencies of the text after removing stopwords. The exploratory data analysis, or EDA, outputs some general statistics, including mean, median, mode, trimmed mean, standard deviation, interquartiles, and plotted histograms using `pandas` dataframes. It also introduces a simple machine learning model using `sklearn` to run a Linear Regression model using a sample dataset from the `sklearn` module.
